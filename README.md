## Challenge

This challenge is for you to make use of your problem solving skills as well as demonstrate your understanding of good object-oriented programming and SOLID design principles.

At UNiDAYS our business is built on providing discounts to students. Your challenge is to build a basic discount system that applies discounts to an online shopping order and calculates the total price based on a set of pricing rules.

You may complete the challenge in any programming language you wish.

### Pricing Rules

| Item | Price  | Discount |
| ---- | ------ | -------- |
| A    | £8.00  | None |
| B    | £12.00 | 2 for £20.00 |
| C    | £4.00  | 3 for £10.00 |
| D    | £7.00  | Buy 1 get 1 free |
| E    | £5.00  | 3 for the price of 2 |
